==Abstract==

BIP283 reserves the number 283 of the first level of BIP32 tree structure for the "purpose": Hierarchical Deterministic symmetric encryption/decription keys for Metanet ROOT nodes.


==Motivation==

Given that files stored in the blockchain are publicly accessible to anyone, in certain uses encryption will be required.

To avoid collision between wallets/apps, this BIP 283 reserves the derivation path 283' for Metanet root nodes' data encryption/decryption keys.

Thus, a Metanet root node created on route m / 281 '/ 0 will have its encryption/decryption keys on route m / 283' / 0. 
For example, the 256 bits of the "x" coordinate of the public key obtained from m / 283 '/ 0 can be used as the symmetric encryption/decryption key, and offers faily good 256-bit randomness for symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES-256.


==Background==

BIP32 describes hierarchical deterministic wallets which can be shared partially or entirely with different systems

BIP43 defines the "purpose" of the first level of BIP32 tree structure: m/purpose'/...

BIP44 reserves number 44 of the first level of BIP32 tree structure for the "purpose": Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets: m/44'/...

BIP281 reserves the number 281 of the first level of BIP32 tree structure for the "purpose": Hierarchical Deterministic Metanet ROOT nodes.


==Specification==

This BIP283 reserves number 283 of the first level of BIP32 tree structure for the BIP43 "purpose": Hierarchical Deterministic symmetric encryption keys for Metanet ROOT nodes

Thus, given a "m" master private key, the hierarchically generated symmetric encryption keys for Metanet root nodes will be:
  m / 283' / 0  -->  is the symmetric encryption key path of the 1st metanet root node
  m / 283' / 1  -->  is the symmetric encryption key path of the 2nd metanet root node 
  m / 283' / 2  -->  is the symmetric encryption key path of the 3rd metanet root node 
  ...

(Apostrophe indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used).
